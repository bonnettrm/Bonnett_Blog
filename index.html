    <h2>The Adventures of a Travel Nurse, a Remote Worker, and their Greyhound</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Bobby, my wife is Sammy, and our greyhound is named Maui. We are making this blog to help us remember our travels, keep our friends and family up to date, and to help other looking for tips and tricks to live a vagabond lifestyle. We are far from experts at traveling, but we have developed a great style that has led to some fantastic adventures. We hope you enjoy following along with our adventures!
